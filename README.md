# YOLOv8 and ByteTrack Object Detection and Counting ðŸ’»

Welcome to this project's repository! This project focuses on efficient object detection, tracking, and counting using YOLOv8 for initial detection and ByteTrack from Supervision for precise object tracking. I implemented a robust system where objects are assigned specific tracking IDs and tracked using ByteTrack, enabling accurate counting with Supervision's line zone feature. The system incorporates in and out lanes for two-way traffic, ensuring comprehensive object counting capabilities.

### Key Features:
- **Object Detection:** Utilize YOLOv8 for initial object detection with high accuracy.
- **Object Tracking:** Employ ByteTrack from Supervision for precise object tracking and assigning unique tracking IDs.
- **Line Zone Counting:** Implement Supervision's line zone class feature to count objects as they cross designated lines, facilitating accurate counting in both in and out lanes.
- **Efficiency:** Achieve efficient and accurate object detection, tracking, and counting for dynamic environments.

### Usage:
1. **Object Detection with YOLOv8:** Run YOLOv8 to detect objects in the scene.
2. **Object Tracking with ByteTrack:** Utilize ByteTrack for precise object tracking and assign tracking IDs.
3. **Counting with Supervision's Line Zone:** Implement Supervision's line zone feature to enable accurate counting as objects cross designated lines in both in and out lanes.
